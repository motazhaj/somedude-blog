            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p class="blogBody">
            Today marks three weeks since I left my job as a professional Architectural Engineer and a
            Lead 3D artist and producer for YouTube educational content. It's also the first day of my exciting 
            journey into learning web development.
            <br><br>
            My past experience includes working with C++ development and honing my game development skills in Unreal Engine,
            mainly focusing on design and 3D art.
            <br><br>
            Armed with this background, I'm filled with confidence and high motivation as I embark on this new adventure.
            <br><br>
            Being a problem-solver by nature, 
            I am eager to apply my technical expertise and artistic creativity to create compelling and user-friendly websites.
            <br><br>
            Transitioning from Architectural Engineering and 3D art to web development is a thrilling opportunity to leverage
            my diverse skill set. 
            <br><br>
            My aspiration is to develop interactive web applications that are high valued and expand people's knowledge.
            <br><br>
            Combining my background as an Architectural Engineer with my passion for creative storytelling,
            I am determined to deliver top-quality content that makes a positive impact on viewers.
            <br><br>
            With each milestone, I will update this blog while I learn, and adapt,
            ensuring a successful transition into the world of web development.
